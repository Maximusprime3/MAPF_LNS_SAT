The probSAT SAT Solver

An efficient implementation of a variant of the probSAT solver presented in:

"Choosing Probability Distributions for Stochastic Local Search and the Role of Make versus Break" by
Adrian Balint, Uwe Sch√∂ning

published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2012, Volume 7317, Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2012, pages 16-29

This version does not track the make values of variables and is thus also not able to use them. 

=======
To build the solver run:

make

=======
To run the solver:

./probSAT instance.cnf <seed>

=======
The solver accepts a series of parameters which can be displayed by typing:

./probSAT -h

In-Memory API Usage (for C/C++ Integration)
-------------------------------------------

probSAT can be used as a library via its in-memory API, allowing you to solve SAT problems directly from your C/C++ code without file I/O.

**Function signature:**

```c
int probsat_solve_in_memory(
    int numVars,                // Number of variables
    int numClauses,             // Number of clauses
    int** clauses,              // Array of pointers to clauses (each clause is an array of ints, ending with 0)
    long long seed,             // Random seed
    long long maxRuns,          // Maximum number of tries
    long long maxFlips,         // Maximum number of flips per try
    ProbSatResult* result,      // Output struct for results
    int* initialAssignment      // (Optional) Initial assignment array (1/0), or NULL for random
);
```

**Result struct:**
```c
typedef struct {
    int sat;            // 1 for SAT, 0 for UNSAT
    int* assignment;    // Array of variable assignments (1 for true, 0 for false)
    int num_flips;      // Number of flips performed
    double solve_time;  // Time taken to solve (seconds)
    // More stats can be added as needed
} ProbSatResult;
```

**Minimal usage example:**
```c
#include "probSAT_inmem.c"

// Example: Solve (x1 OR ~x2) AND (~x1 OR x2)
int main() {
    int numVars = 2;
    int numClauses = 2;
    // Each clause is an array ending with 0
    int clause1[] = { 1, -2, 0 };   // x1 OR ~x2
    int clause2[] = { -1, 2, 0 };   // ~x1 OR x2
    int* clauses[3];                // 1-based indexing
    clauses[1] = clause1;
    clauses[2] = clause2;
    ProbSatResult result;
    int status = probsat_solve_in_memory(
        numVars,
        numClauses,
        clauses,
        42,         // seed
        10,         // maxRuns
        1000,       // maxFlips
        &result,
        NULL        // initialAssignment (NULL = random)
    );
    if (result.sat == 10) {
        printf("SAT found! Assignment: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < numVars; ++i) printf("%d ", result.assignment[i]);
        printf("\n");
    } else {
        printf("UNSAT or not found.\n");
    }
    free(result.assignment);
    return 0;
}
```
