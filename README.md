# MDDConstructor Project

This project implements a Multi-value Decision Diagram (MDD) constructor in C++. It provides functionality to build MDDs for grid-based pathfinding problems, supporting features like obstacle handling, shortest path calculation, and flexible time-step management.

## Building the Project

To build the project, use the following command:

```
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -o main MDDConstructor.cpp MDD.cpp MDDNode.cpp
```

Replace `main` with your desired output executable name, and ensure all required source files are listed.

## Usage
- The code is designed for research and educational purposes related to pathfinding and decision diagrams.
- See the source files for more details on usage and implementation.
